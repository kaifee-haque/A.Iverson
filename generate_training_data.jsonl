A number will be set prior to the game and the player has the choice of betting whether the total final score will be higher or lower than the listed number. Players can also bet team-specific over/unders if they think a certain team will score more or less than their listed number. This type of bet can also be made on specific parts of the game, such as the First Quarter, First Half, First Five Innings of an MLB game, etc."}
{"prompt": "Give me an example of an over/under.", "completion": "If the over/under for Lakers vs Suns is set at 217, the player can bet the total score to add up to a higher or lower number than 217.

{"prompt": "Give me an example of a parlay.", "completion": "Placing a 3-team parlay on the Patriots, Rams, and Chiefs will pay out if each team covers their respective spread.
